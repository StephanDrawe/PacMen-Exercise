# PacMen-Exercise
## Description:
This is a modified version of the 'PacMen-Factory' project assignment through MIT coding bootcamp.
This project creates images of PacMan at different locations in the browser upon clicking the 'Add PacMan' button. After clicking the 'Start Game' button, the program moves all of the PacMen created all at once at different intervals and bounces the Pacmen off the borders of the browers base on the browser size.
## How to Run:
1. Fork the repository in its entirety into your account.
2. clone the repository to your machine.
3. Open the 'index.html' file in your browser of choice.
4. Click the 'Add PacMan' button to add a single PacMan to the screen. Click the button again to add more.
5. Click the 'Start Game' button to move all of the created PacMen across the browser.
6. To clear the brower, simply refresh the window.
7. Repeat steps 1 through 6.
## Roadmap of future improvements:
In the next iterations of the program, we will add more styles to the background and images.
